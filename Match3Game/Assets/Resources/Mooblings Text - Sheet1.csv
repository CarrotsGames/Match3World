14,now let's learn the basics,Gobu Tutorial
15,above is the score and gold count,Gobu Tutorial
16,the score will increase as you play and connect nodes,Gobu Tutorial
17,to do this drag your finger over a set of atleast 3 matching nodes, like this,Gobu Tutorial
18,be careful though sometimes bad nodes will spawn, these nodes can only be cleared with power-ups,Gobu Tutorial
19,these nodes are broken nodes that can't be matched anymore you will need to use the Super Bomb,Gobu Tutorial
20,Great! now these colourful nodes here are rainbow nodes, mixed nodes that have joined, use a Super Colour Remover on them,Gobu Tutorial
21,Great! now that bar below your score is this Mooblings happiness,Gobu Tutorial
22,when Mooblings get happy they fall asleep so raise that bar by connecting nodes,Gobu Tutorial
23,here let me help you, when a moobling falls asleep gold coins will start too fall onto the board,Gobu Tutorial
24,by connecting 3 or more gold pieces together they will be added to you gold total,Gobu Tutorial
25,now one last thing when a Moobling falls asleep the score multiplier indicated by the red number,Gobu Tutorial
26,will increase so your score will also increase faster, put lots of Mooblings to sleep,Gobu Tutorial
